# Discuss

Discuss is a platform made to help out freshers @ IIIT-Hyderabad start out in competitive programming, while simultaneously helping them with their course.

## Website Functionality

We will be posting four kinds of articles on this page:

* The Hint Page: This page will be active for each problem when each OJ assignment is put up. Certain hints and possible testcases will be uploaded here.

* The Editorial Page: After each OJ ends, the Hints page for each problem will change to an Editorial page which would contain a proper analysis and solution of each problem.

* The Tutorial Page: Would contain useful and really cool algorithms tutorials, updated at not so regular intervals.

* The Problem Set Page: Special and good problem sets will be shared here, which can be wither made up, or taken directly from a source.

## Usage

Everyone can access the website @ https://prajneya.github.io/Discuss/ .
Genuine feedbacks are welcome. Discuss is currently a work in progress, where articles, editorials, tutorials and problem sets are contributed by students of the same batch.
Certain functionalities such as search and comments are also underway. Commenting on articles is anonymous, though a decorum is expected and it is hoped that a strict no-spamming policy is maintained.
