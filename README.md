# Discuss

Discuss is a platform made to help out freshers @ IIIT-Hyderabad start out in competitive programming, while simultaneously helping them with their course.

## Website Functionality

We will be posting three kinds of articles on this page:

* The Editorial Page: After each OJ ends, the Hints page for each problem will change to an Editorial page which would contain a proper analysis and solution of each problem.

* The Tutorial Page: Would contain useful and really cool algorithms tutorials, updated at not so regular intervals.

* The Problem Set Page: Special and good problem sets will be shared here, which can be wither made up, or taken directly from a source.

## Usage

Everyone can access the website @ https://prajneya.github.io/Discuss/ .
Genuine feedbacks are welcome. Discuss is currently a work in progress, where articles, editorials, tutorials and problem sets are contributed by students of the same batch.
Certain functionalities such as search and comments are also underway.
I am still working on some backend fixes, so the feedback/email-updates may not work some time, I appreciate the patience.


## Contributing

Both developers and non-developers are invited to contribute to this project by adding a PR. If genuine, the changes would be approved and added to the master branch.
